# VTU SGPA Calculator

During my Engineering journey as a VTU student, I noticed one common frustration calculating SGPA & CGPA manually every semester.

When results are published in marks, we have to manually calculate the SGPA for each semester and then the CGPAâ€¦ or rely on online tools where we still need to type subject names, codes, internals, and externals manually. Itâ€™s time-consuming, error-prone, and honestlyâ€¦ not the best way to spend your time after a long exam season. ðŸ˜…

## My Solution

 I built a VTU SGPA & CGPA Calculator ðŸ§® using Next.js + TypeScript + Gemini AI + Radix UI, hosted on Vercel, making the process quick, accurate, and stress-free!

Just upload the screenshot or PDF of your original result and boom you get your SGPA instantly âœ¨

## Core Features

-   **Marksheet Input**: Upload marksheet images (PNG, JPG) or PDFs.
-   **AI Data Extraction**: Uses Google's Gemini model via Genkit to automatically extract student details, subject information, and marks from the marksheet.
-   **Manual Entry**: A user-friendly form for manual entry of marks if an image is unavailable or extraction fails.
-   **SGPA Calculation**: Accurately calculates SGPA based on extracted marks and credits.
-   **CGPA Calculator**: A separate tool to calculate overall CGPA from individual semester SGPA scores.
-   **Downloadable Reports**: Generate and download a professional-looking SGPA report in PDF format.
-   **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive interface built with ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS.

## Tech Stack

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bgmanu2426/VTU-SGPA_Calculator.git
    cd VTU-SGPA_Calculator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Google AI API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
    ```
